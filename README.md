## Preface

[Web Services](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_service) also have their own language to describe his clients contract.

The [WSDL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Services_Description_Language) allows you to specify the functional interface (port type) - operations with inputs, outputs and errors - and also linking (binding) with specific technologies - usually [SOAP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOAP) over [HTTP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol).

[WSDL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Services_Description_Language) is based on [XML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML) in order to be independent of the platform and uses [XSD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML_Schema_(W3C)) to set the description of the types of input and output data (errors) in each operation.
